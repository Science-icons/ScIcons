# Scicons

Scicons is a opernsource icon project with the vision to create a range of stylised opensource accessible science themed icons that can represent the diversity of science.

## Current Icons
There are currently 22 scicons published. The base set of icons are created with a black and white base.

## Future Additions

There are no concrete plans to extend the available scicons. 

If the project does end up growing there are a few thoughts on features:
* a taxonomy/tag system for classifying icons built into their SVG.
* primary/secondary colouring layer built into SVG nodes
* UI Interface for colouring and browsing icons.
* Searchable icons (building of the taxonomy to find icons within fields e.g. chemstry -> equipment)

Other contributers are welcome, scicon designed should be made in a cohesive manner.

If there is interest for this project a donation link may be added to pay artists for additions.

## About the Project
Scicons is a opensource project founded by Benjamin Maclaren. The first scicons were commissioned by Ben and produced by artist Jamie McCaw. Scicons were created using adobe illustrator and are available in SVG formats.
