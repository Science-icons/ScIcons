## Future Additions

There are no concrete plans to extend the available scicons. If the project does end up growing a taxonomy/tag system will be developed.

Other contributers are welcome, scicon designed should be made in a cohesive manner.

If there is interest for this project a donation link may be added to pay artists for additions.

## About the Project
Scicons is a opensource project founded by Benjamin Maclaren. The first scicons were commissioned by Ben and produced by artist Jamie McCaw. Scicons were created using adobe illustrator and are available in SVG formats.
