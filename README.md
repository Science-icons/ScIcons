# Scicons

Scicons is a opensource project founded by Benjamin Maclaren, the first scicons were commissioned by Ben and produced by artist Jamie McCaw. Scicons were created using adobe illustrator and are available in SVG formats.

The vision of scicons is to create a range of opensource accessible science themed icons that can represent the diversity of areas and work in science.
